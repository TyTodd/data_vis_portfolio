    <p class="c4">
      <span class="c1"
        >When creating these visualizations, I realized how much design choices
        can influence perception, even when working with the same dataset. When
        exploring the data I found it was very hard to make comparisons across
        ethnicities because the majority of complainants were black and the
        majority of officers were white. I had trouble figuring out what a good
        normalization factor would be. Then, in the first visualization, I found
        a way to ensure fairness by normalizing allegation counts within each
        complainant ethnicity group, ensuring a proportionate comparison. I also
        found that grouping allegations and dispositions into broader categories
        helped simplify the data. There were over 100 allegation types, some
        were the exact same thing just with capital letters in different places.
        The dispositions had 9 different substantiated types for the different
        outcomes of the substantiated allegation. Adding percentage labels
        further enhanced readability, making it easier for viewers to interpret
        differences across groups. However, the choice to exclude
        unsubstantiated allegations was more complex&mdash;it removed
        potentially unreliable data but also risked omitting real incidents that
        lacked confirmation.</span
      >
    </p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c4">
      <span class="c1"
        >In the second visualization, filtering out exonerated allegations
        significantly altered the narrative, shifting the perception of who was
        more likely to be physically assaulted by police. While this choice
        technically adhered to the counter-proposition, it also demonstrated
        another systemic issue, that when cops physically assault
        african-americans they are more likely to be exonerated than when they
        assault white people. The negative earnesty score reflects the ethical
        implications of omitting confirmed incidents simply because they were
        not classified as misconduct. This exercise underscored the power of
        data visualization in shaping narratives and the responsibility that
        comes with it. Every design choice&mdash;whether in filtering,
        categorization, or labeling&mdash;carries an implicit bias, making
        transparency and intent critical for ethical data storytelling.</span
