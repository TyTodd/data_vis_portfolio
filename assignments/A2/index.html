        instantly connected to this issue as someone who grew up in a low income
        household that was run by corporate landlords there were plenty of times
        my family came scarily close to eviction and had to sometimes choose
        between power and rent (in which rent always won). I also felt motivated
        to pursue this subtheme because I have heard in the news about BlackRock
        buying up almost half of them homes in the US which I am not sure if it
        is, it is extremely scary the implications of corporations owning the
        majority of housing.</span

        >Looking at these charts that show owner occupancy rates over time for
        every neighborhood shows the other side of the story. In most
        neighborhoods owner occupancy rates are declining. Interestingly though
        not as steeply as corporate occupancy rates are increasing. This shows
        that the two are not actually conjugates of each other and though they
        may be a little correlated, they are not strongly correlated. This is
        expected as the other factor at play is individual landlords. Zooming in
        on specific neighborhoods tells other interesting stories. Looking at
        South Boston Waterfront, we see a giant increase in owner occupancy
        during the 2008 housing crisis, and we see that number drop during the
        2020 pandemic. This is a little counterintuitive since from my
        understanding it was harder to buy a house in 2008 and actually
        relatively easier to buy a house from 2020 to 2021. It seems like the
        first graph actually has an answer for this. In 2020 and 2021, corporate
        ownership skyrocketed in this neighborhood. This leads me to believe
        that because of higher unemployment rates and job insecurity during
        COVID the residents of this neighborhood were not able to take advantage
        of lower mortgage interest rates and the corporations who already have
        high capital saved up beat them to it. This brings me to my next two
        questions: </span

        The theme found from the last graph remains, corporate ownership
        increased the most in 2020 for whiter neighborhoods. My hypothesis also
        remains the same, these neighborhoods such as downtown, waterfront,
        beacon hill all contain valuable properties and corporations were ready
        to take advantage of lower prices during the pandemic. I also made a map
        of corporate ownership in 2024. I felt these maps didn&rsquo;t bring the
        data together in a concise enough way so I tried to bridge that gap in

        Is it a property value thing or maybe a gentrification thing? This is
        when I posed another question because there is a value that is missing
        that I haven&#39;t graphed yet. There are corporate landlords, there are

        This field also told an interesting story because it had similar
        correlations as the corporate ownership rates. With whites and asians
        having a positive correlation and blacks and hispanics having a negative
        correlation. This brought me to the conclusion that since both corporate
        and individual landlord rates are high in neighborhoods with higher
        numbers of whites and asians, likely what&#39;s going on is that
        landlords whether corporate or individuals tend to just not want to rent
        to black and hispanics. What&#39;s more interesting is comparing the
        corporate and individual landlordship rates we see these racial
        correlations are higher for corporate landlords than they are for
        individual landlords which is also to be expected. After seeing the data

        Meanwhile, owner occupancy rates have remained relatively stable,
        showing that the rise in corporate ownership isn&#39;t solely displacing

        stated that corporate landlords are more likely to evict their tenants.
        Ultimately, corporate landlords treat housing purely as an investment,
        capitalizing on financial instability at the expense of tenant
        stability. These trends reinforce concerns about displacement,
        affordability, and the need for stronger tenant protections against
        corporate consolidation in the housing market. From this I think the
        data does support the policies proposed in the New York Times article
        which try to increase the number of individual landlords as opposed to
        corporate landlords.
